Test Driven Development is an approach to coding in which you write tests before features. The approach generally follows these steps.  
  
First: write a single unit test to check on a part of the appâ€™s behavior.  
  
Second: observe the test failing.  
  
Third: Write the code to pass the test.  
  
Finally, refactor the code to reduce duplication and lines.  

A unit test checks the smallest possible part of an application for proper behavior.  

Jest is a test runner made by Facebook to test JavaScript environments and is most frequently used to test React applications.

Snapshot testing in Jest keeps a recorded history of testing files in order to ensure that previous snapshots match current snapshots that generate when the application changes. 

Enzyme is a testing utility library made by Airbnb that allow us to interact with React components. 

Behavior Driven Development is a variation of test driven development that hones in on user scenarios and behaviors that affect the app state.  

Given, when, and then/and represent key words in the BDD structure and help document the user scenarios for the application.
